Hello! I am a statistics major with senior standing at Cal Poly SLO, and my minor is in Computer Science. I will graduate with a Bachelor's degree in December 2022.

I worked with Dr. Schroth-Glanz at Cal Poly on a Marine Bioacoustic Analysis research project this summer. I enhanced my ability to train neural networks on large datasets.

Currently, I am working with Unanimous AI to further improve their revolutionary Swarm technology in the context of sports betting.

A long-term goal of mine is to become a certified actuary, but I am open to exploring a variety of data-related avenues along the way.

My other work experience includes being a private tutor, Leadership Development Intern with RippleMatch, statistics department grader at Cal Poly, math instructor for Mathnasium, and office assistant intern for GS Laboratories.

If you would like to view samples of my work on GitHub, please let me know and I can provide access.

Overall, I have a passion for working with data and helping others with my well-rounded skillset. I look forward to exploring future opportunities to apply my strengths in a professional setting.
