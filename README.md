Hi! I am a statistics major with senior standing at Cal Poly SLO. My minor is in Computer Science, and I am also taking business classes to bolster my financial knowledge. I will graduate with a Bachelor's degree in December 2022.

I was recently hired by RippleMatch as a Leadership Development Intern for this Spring! RippleMatch is a tech company that uses AI to reliably match college students with job opportunities. Applications and their status are centralized on their site, meaning that you can use a single profile with every application instead of needing to re-enter the same information every time you apply to a different company. This allows you to save time in not only finding a job but also applying for it, ensuring that you can focus your efforts on company research and interviews. I highly recommend trying it out, especially since it is free to make an account.

I am also working to acquire an undergraduate internship involving data analysis or data science during this upcoming summer. A long-term goal of mine is to become a certified actuary, but I am open to exploring a variety of data-related avenues along the way.

I have work experience as a private tutor, a grader for Cal Poly's statistics department, a math instructor for Mathnasium, and an office assistant intern for GS Laboratories.

If you would like to view samples of my work on GitHub, please let me know and I can provide access.

Overall, I have a passion for working with data and helping others with my well-rounded skillset. I look forward to exploring future opportunities to apply my strengths in a professional setting.
