Hello! I am a statistics major with senior standing at Cal Poly SLO. My minor is in Computer Science, and I am also taking business classes to bolster my financial knowledge. I will graduate with a Bachelor's degree in December 2022.

I am working with Dr. Schroth-Glanz at Cal Poly on a Marine Bioacoustic Analysis research project this summer. I am refining my ability to train neural networks on large datasets.

A long-term goal of mine is to become a certified actuary, but I am open to exploring a variety of data-related avenues along the way.

I have work experience as a private tutor, Leadership Development Intern with RippleMatch, statistics department grader at Cal Poly, math instructor for Mathnasium, and office assistant intern for GS Laboratories.

If you would like to view samples of my work on GitHub, please let me know and I can provide access.

Overall, I have a passion for working with data and helping others with my well-rounded skillset. I look forward to exploring future opportunities to apply my strengths in a professional setting.
